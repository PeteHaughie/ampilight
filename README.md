# AMPILIGHT

A DIY Philips Ambilight-a-like built on a Rapsberry Pi 3 (I think), a 20 Euro capture card, a HDMI splitter, two extra HDMI cables, and a strip or two of Neopixel LEDs (depending on the size of your TV).

## How does it work?

Taking the image from the capture card every few tenths of a second, reducing the scale to something a bit more manageable, *something I haven't thought about here*, run website see what the machine is currently doing with websockets, output to lights.
